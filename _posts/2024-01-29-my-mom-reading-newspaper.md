It brings joy to see my mom leisurely reading the newspaper in the sun. Since my school days, our dad instilled the habit of having newspapers at home and we used to get the English edition. She is a Hindi teacher and has decent proficiency in English, however, having a Telugu newspaper makes a significant difference for her. This simple decision to have both newspapers allows her to enjoy reading them every day, creating little moments of joy.

We understand their sacrifices, when we become parents!

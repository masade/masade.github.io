Few teachers inspire us, and a few make you who you are! Miss Laxmi was one such teacher, we will miss you!

For more than four decades, she graced our school (St. Joseph's Convent - Adilabad) and dedicated herself to the noble pursuit of imparting education. I am one of the thousands of students for whom she was an inspiration and a catalyst for positive change.

Down-to-earth and radiating boundless energy, she would ride her bicycle to school well into her 60s, a living testament to her unwavering passion and unmatched commitment. I can vividly picture her childlike smile and the occasional moments of sulking on the entire class. She used to remember most of her students by name. She loved all of us :)

On a personal note, I got introduced to her in Class 5 and she affectionately called me "Paresh-aan". While I was good at math and science, it was under her guidance that I discovered the beauty of social studies. She sparked my curiosity about the intricacies of the world, motivating me to actively engage in GK quizzes and competitions. This inculcated in me the habit of reading newspapers at a very early age.

She was the one who made me believe in myself and the passion to dedicate life to a cause. Little things that define who you are today!

This small note is a tribute to Miss Laxmi and every inspiring teacher who shares the spirit. We look forward to carrying with us the torch of your legacy!

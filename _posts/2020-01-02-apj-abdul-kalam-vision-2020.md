Kalam has a special significance in my life. At the beginning of millenium, when I just graduated from high school, he gave the vision of "India 2020" - India's potential and importance of becoming a knowledge super power! About a decade ago I embarked on the journey contributing to the vision in my own small way!

20 years on, we are in 2020 and a coincidence that today I got an opportunity to visit his birthplace Rameswaram!

I feel blessed to have started this decade with a pilgrimage to Vivekananda Rock Memorial yesterday and House of Kalam today!

Visited house of kalam and his alma-mater with our Junior Kalam!

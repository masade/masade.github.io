I go to bed with her every night!<br/>
And sometimes when the sun’s shining all bright!<br/>

She teases me, by trying to clasp<br/>
Every time I have to work whole night!<br/>

Teases again when I am obsessed with her<br/>
Moving away like the mirage in a desert!<br/>

She used to come along in every class,<br/>
And played the game of hide and seek!<br/>

After a hard day, I reach home from the work,<br/>
She quickly embraces me and relieves all the stress!<br/>

She does not leave me a single day,<br/>
And I cannot live without her.<br/>

I know she loves me the most,<br/>
And I love her more than anyone on earth!<br/>

My girlfriend envies her, but loves her more than I do,<br/>
for she too cannot leave without the "Sleep"<br/>

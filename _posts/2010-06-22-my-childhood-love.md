I go to bed with her every night!
And sometimes when the sun’s shining all bright!

She teases me, by trying to clasp
Every time I have to work whole night!

Teases again when I am obsessed with her
Moving away like the mirage in a desert!

She used to come along in every class,
And played the game of hide and seek!

After a hard day, I reach home from the work,
She quickly hugs me and relieves all the stress!

She does not leave me a single day,
And I cannot live without her.

I know she loves me the most,
And I love her more than anyone on earth!

My girlfriend envies her, but loves her more than I do,
for she too cannot live without the "Sleep"

I shied away from calling myself "CEO" when I started Coherendz (Vaave) in College. I carried a designation called "Business Development Manager" in my email signature. While I felt overwhelmed using the title for a small team, the role has taught me the most important lesson early in my life - "You cannot give excuses". There is no boss above you and you cannot tell that to a customer. Today, I understand, the designation is a symbol of responsibility, something that says you are accountable. If there is no one in the company responsible to do a task, it is your work - You are the "Chief Everything-Else Officer!"

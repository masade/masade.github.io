When an old friend reaches out after years of silence — and only after you've become successful — don't you instinctively question the timing?

It feels transactional. That, unfortunately, is the problem with many Indian institutions.

The 100 Cr Alumni Pledges we have seen recently are inspiring. But, even in India's most powerful institutions, only a handful of alumni donate at this scale.

This is not a culture of giving back. These are exceptions.

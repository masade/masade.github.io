When an old friend reaches out after years of silence — and only after you've become successful — don't you instinctively question the timing?

It feels transactional. That, unfortunately, is the problem with many Indian institutions.

In recent years, we've seen large alumni pledges: ₹100 crore at IIT Kanpur (Class of 2000), ₹70 crore at IIT Delhi (Class of 2000), ₹95 crore at IIT Bombay, and ₹36 crore at BITS Pilani.

These are inspiring stories. But here's the uncomfortable truth:

Even in India's most powerful institutions, only a handful of alumni donate at this scale.

This is not a culture of giving back. These are exceptions. When institutions ask for money, only a very small fraction respond.

## The Real Problem

Many institutions look at these headlines and ask: "Why aren't we able to raise funds?" The answer is simple.

Fundraising is not a strategy. It is an outcome.

Most institutions have been silent for years — no engagement, no relationship, no continuity. And then one day, they reach out, almost as if support is their right. It is like calling a childhood friend after they've become successful — not to reconnect, but to ask for help.

## My Three Insights

Having spoken to hundreds of alumni, I see a consistent pattern.

1. The intent to give back is abundant. Most alumni genuinely want to contribute in some form — time, mentorship, networks, or money.

2. Outreach after years of silence feels transactional. And transactions do not build trust.

3. Institutions lack systems to convert belonging into meaningful, measurable impact.

## My Controversial View

I would rather see: ₹20,000 from 1,000 alumni — impacting 1,000 students than ₹2 crore from a single donor. Because Money builds infrastructure. Connection builds culture.

If 10% of your alumni give, you have a culture. If 0.01% give, you have a headline.

## Most Indian institutions are not yet ready.

They must invest seriously in nurturing relationships — in what I call a reflexive state, where engagement is continuous, not episodic. You ask for something, and alumni just come forward to help - not just money, but many other things!

If you nurture relationships consistently, you don't have to ask. Alumni themselves step forward.

Until we move from "Who gave?" to "How many feel connected?" those 100-crore donations will remain exceptions — not a movement.

India doesn't lack alumni who can give. India lacks an alumni strategy.

And that's the debate we should be having. What's your view?

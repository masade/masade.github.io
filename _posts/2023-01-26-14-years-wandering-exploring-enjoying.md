It was today, exactly 14 years ago, I moved from NITIE to Hyderabad choosing entrepreneurship over placements. Yesterday, I met my school friend and one of my early backers Kapil Reddy and he asked me "What kept you going for so long?", that was when I realized it I had been on this nomadic journey for the last 14 years! - Wandering, Exploring, and Enjoying!

So, What kept me going for so long?

- I still wake up excited about everything that we are doing. The belief that alumni mentoring & career guidance is essential to improve the Quality of Education in India, brings in a sense of purpose.

- While we have a full product team, I love coding and spend hours every week building something new and keep learning new technologies every other day.

- We have a few best-of-the-sales teams, but I consider myself to be a [Good] Sales Man. I spend time meeting customers, listening to them, and always looking for insights. They keep showing me, there is a lot more we can do.

More than the reasons above, I feel I am blessed to have so many wonderful people supporting me - my co-founders, friends, alumni, mentors, investors and my family.

We have a long way to go, help a lot of students with their careers! Keep sending all your good wishes. Thank you, everyone!

Feeling Humbled!

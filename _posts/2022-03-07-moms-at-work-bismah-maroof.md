It feels so empowering to see this! The Pakistani all-rounder Bismah Maroof with her daughter surrounded by the Indian Cricket Team personally broke many stereotypes for me -

1) I always knew that being a woman is tough and felt we as a society need to support them to ace in their careers, Maroof proved us wrong. Women are born with this special ability. I wish I would be able to learn to strike a fine balance between Parenthood and an entrepreneur.

2) Contradicting the label of Muslim women as choice less, voiceless victims of their culture and religion, this Mom Cricketer from a Muslim Majority Nation has shown that notion we carry in our minds has to change!

3) The Rivalry between teams is just a political makeover and savvy marketing, understanding the psychological need to pick one side. Indian players gathering around the baby girl shows how professional players are just with needs like those of common people.

Women do not need support, they can very well take care of themselves. All we need to do is to acknowledge that they're different. The rules in corporate careers were not designed to promote equity, let's be inclusive and change them!

Do tell me what do you feel about the picture and did it inspire you?

*A small snippet of a young boy questioning the love.*

Kaise mai izhaar karu,
Ye jo hai dil ki baat
Kahu to mai kya kahu,
Ye jo hai dil ki baat

Dil ne dil se kah to diya
Aakhon ney bhi to ishaara kiya
In labon ko bas ab kehna hai
Par lafzo mey ab kyon kehna hai

Pyaar hi to hai is dil mey
Tum bhi to ho isi dil mey,
Tum hi to meri himmat ho
Phir kehne se kyon darta ye dil

Pyaar to tumhe bhi hai
Isey hubahu samajhta hai dil
Ye jo hai dil ki baat
Ab labon ko kyon kahna hai

**PURPORT**

How should I say,
What should I say,
These are words of the heart.

Hearts have spoken, Eyes have Spoken,
Now I just need to say in words (lips should speak),
Why do I have to say in words?

Love resides in the heart, you are also in the same heart

You are my courage, then why is the heart afraid?

You also love me, the heart knows it very well,
these words of heart, Do I really have to say in words?

*A small snippet of a young boy questioning the love.*

Kaise mai izhaar karu,<br/>
Ye jo hai dil ki baat<br/>
Kahu to mai kya kahu,<br/>
Ye jo hai dil ki baat<br/>

Dil ne dil se kah to diya<br/>
Aakhon ney bhi to ishaara kiya<br/>
In labon ko bas ab kehna hai<br/>
Par lafzo mey ab kyon kehna hai<br/>

Pyaar hi to hai is dil mey<br/>
Tum bhi to ho isi dil mey,<br/>
Tum hi to meri himmat ho<br/>
Phir kehne se kyon darta ye dil<br/>

Pyaar to tumhe bhi hai<br/>
Isey hubahu samajhta hai dil<br/>
Ye jo hai dil ki baat<br/>
Ab labon ko kyon kahna hai<br/>

**PURPORT**

How should I say,<br/> what should I say,<br/> these are words of the heart.

Hearts have spoken, Eyes have Spoken, <br/>Now I just need to say in words (lips should speak),<br/>Why do I have to say in words?

Love resides in the heart, you are also beside in the same heart<br/>
You are my courage, but then why is the heart afraid?

You also love me, the heart knows it very well, <br/>these words of heart, Do I really have to say in words?

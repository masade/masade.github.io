A small snippet of a young boy questioning the love.

Kaise mai izhaar karu,<br/>
Ye jo hai dil ki baat<br/>
Kahu to mai kya kahu,<br/>
Ye jo hai dil ki baat<br/>

Dil ne dil se kah to diya<br/>
Aakhon ney bhi to ishaara kiya<br/>
In labon ko bas ab kehna hai<br/>
Par lafzo mey ab kyon kehna hai<br/>

Pyaar hi to hai is dil mey<br/>
Tum bhi to ho is dil mey,<br/>
Tum hi to meri himmat ho<br/>
Phir kehne se kyon darta ye dil<br/>

Pyaar to tumhe bhi hai<br/>
Isey hubahu samajhta hai dil<br/>
Ye jo hai dil ki baat<br/>
Ab labon ko kyon kahna hai<br/>


PURPORT<br/>
How should i convey, what should i convey, these are words of the heart.

Hearts have spoken, Eyes have Spoken, <br/>Just need to say in words (lips should speak), why should i say in words?

Its love filled in this heart, you are also in this heart,<br/> your are my courage, why do i fear (to say)

You love me as well, heart knows it very well, <br/>these words of heart, why should i say it in words

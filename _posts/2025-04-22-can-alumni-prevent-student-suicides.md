It pains me every time I hear about students taking their lives. In these most depressing times, the first help we often need is simply someone to talk to — someone who will listen without judgment or unsolicited advice.

I believe Alumni can play a crucial role by being the first responders and listeners, Like a Big Brother / Big Sister!

Can we create simple and small initiatives on our campuses?

We all have read the heartbreaking incident of a 3rd-year student at IIT Kharagpur committing suicide and Data from NCRB shows as many as 10000+ students commit suicides every year. This sparked a debate in my college group and left me wondering about the role alumni play in preventing student suicides.

Back in my NITIE days, I was like the "5-point someone" guy. I did not get a single shortlist until Day 2 of summer placements. I was a very sharp & confident guy until my graduation but the peer pressure at NITIE was so strong that made me feel worthless for not getting placed in a "dream" company!

Even in my entrepreneurial journey, there were many occasions when I felt very lonely. In those difficult times, you have a loving family and a supporting wife, but you cannot open up to them, so as not to worry them further. I was fortunate to have had some very good mentors & friends I could go and speak to!

In the most critical times, when we feel down and are in dire need of professional help, we often aren't in a position to seek it out. The first help we often need is simply someone to talk to — someone who will listen without judgment or unsolicited advice.

I cannot stress enough the importance of alumni and seniors in filling this role. They can help set realistic expectations, have unfiltered conversations, and act like a big brother or sister.

In the training program I conduct called Alumni Leadership Program (ALP), I emphasize that alumni associations create two formal initiatives 1) Saathi Program and 2) Alumni Emergency Helpline designed to support both students and alumni, focussing on:

- Students on campus cope with peer pressure.
- Individuals going through a mid-life crisis.
- Alumni dealing with troubled relationships or newlywed challenges.
- Those facing abuse at home, especially women.

Seniors can play a crucial role, not by acting as professional counsellors but by being the first responders and listeners. Their support can make a significant difference in someone's life. Let's foster these connections and build stronger support networks within our alumni communities. Do reach out to me if you need help in building these programs.

Last but not least, If you need someone to speak to, I am always available to listen, Just drop a message saying, 'Do you have 8 minutes?' (Inspired by Simon Sinek)

"You stay the CEO."

My team member said this to me on a Monday morning.

They'd spent 10 days building something in silence using Claude Code. No updates. No check-ins. Just a demo when it was ready.

It was solid. It was beautiful. I could see exactly how it was going to shape our entire product journey.

I'm a product guy. I love to code. I'm still hands-on with the product team. But there it was — Claude Code had done all the heavy lifting. The team had built everything.

For a moment, I felt... redundant.

So I asked: "So what's my role now?"

"You stay the CEO. You do nothing."

This moment reminded me of a few things:

- Roles are going to evolve — faster than we think.
- The best teams don't wait for you. They take ownership and move.

and that the real leadership isn't being in the room when things get built. It's building a team that doesn't need you there.

For me, it's also a signal.
It's time to fully evolve from being a founder to a CEO.

Feels strange. But Feels good. Still learning.

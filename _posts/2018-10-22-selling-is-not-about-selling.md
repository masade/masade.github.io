As a newbie to the world of cycling, I visited the Track & Trail store at Uppal about 10 days ago to check few bicycles and met Mr. Dileep. I would say, I made the purchase primarily because of him.

As I entered the store, before suggesting any bikes, he asked me about the purpose. The "Why?". After listening to my requirements, he showed me few suitable bikes and suggested what factors I should consider before choosing a bike. He did not try to sell, he just answered my questions, educated me and told me the parameters I should consider while making the decision. In the process, he gained my trust. Though I checked at few other stores too, I brought it from him as I liked the way he engaged with me. Of course, the bike is very good.

Lessons on Sales:

- People buy from people they trust, majority don't know much about the product/service they are purchasing.
- Trust can only be built by genuinely helping a customer find the best solution to their problem. If it means the customer will choose some other product they feels right for them, so be it! Focus on building relationship!
- Start by listening to the customer and their problems; engage, not advice.
- Be enthusiastic about your product, if you are not, it would be difficult to gather the attention of customer.

I am Paresh Masade, and welcome to my personal website.

Referred as a full-stack founder by my team, I am a Mechanical & Industrial Engineer by Education, and a Programmer & Designer by Passion. My professional journey began as a student entrepreneur at IIM Mumbai (formerly NITIE Mumbai) and graduating in 2009. The recession of 2009 presented me an opportunity to channelize my passsion of web development into full-time entrepreneurship, which led me to founding of [Vaave](https://www.vaave.com){:target="_blank"}.

I belive that education has a potential to impact every aspect of society from quality of life to climate change. At Vaave, we are working to solve the challenges of employability, quality of education and Infrastructure faced by educational institutions by connecting them back to their Alumni. My work at Vaave is dedicated to helping institutions harness these relationships to drive positive change while building a profitable company.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am passionate about cycling, swimming, writing, and poetry, which provide a creative outlet and balance to my life. Explore my site to learn more about my work, my thoughts, and the projects I am passionate about.
